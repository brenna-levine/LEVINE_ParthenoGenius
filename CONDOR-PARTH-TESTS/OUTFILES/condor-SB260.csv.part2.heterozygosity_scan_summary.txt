SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci in input file scanned: 22
Number of loci in input file with missing data: 0
Total number of loci for which mom and offspring do not have missing data: 22
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 12
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained maternal heterozygosity: 0
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0.0
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (based on retained heterozyosity assumption of 66%): 7.92
Range of numbers of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of terminal fusion automixis: > 0.0 - < 7.92
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.0

Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.45455


This parthenogen was likely produced via:	GAMETIC DUPLICATION

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is less than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication.
	Therefore, any apparent offspring heterozygosity at these loci is likely an artifact of error.
