SUMMARY OF RESULTS: SCAN OF MATERNAL HOMOZYGOUS LOCI FOR DISCORDANT OFFSPRING GENOTYPES

Total number of loci analyzed: 20562
Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 20284
Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 123
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.00606
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.99394


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than the error rate.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes at these loci is likely due to sequencing error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
