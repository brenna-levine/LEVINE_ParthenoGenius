Parameters:
	Infile = COBRA-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/baby_1.csv
	Outfile = COBRA-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/baby_1.csv
	Error = 0.01


Total number of loci in input file scanned (may include loci with missing data): 20562


THE FOLLOWING STATS REFERS ONLY TO LOCI AT WHICH NEITHER THE MOTHER NOR OFFSPRING HAVE MISSING DATA:

	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous and offspring are not missing data: 20284
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 123
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 202.84
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.00606
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.99394


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than expected from the genotyping error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes is likely due to genotyping error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
