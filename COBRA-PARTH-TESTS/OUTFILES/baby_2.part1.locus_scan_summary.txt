Parameters:
	Infile = COBRA-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/baby_2.csv
	Outfile = COBRA-PARTH-TESTS/OUTFILES/baby_2
	Error = 0.01
	Het_Scan = 0


Total number of loci analyzed: 20562


Maternal Homozygous Locus Scan Summary:
	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 20284
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 73
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 202.84
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.0036
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.9964


Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.98629


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than expected from the genotyping error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes is likely due to genotyping error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
