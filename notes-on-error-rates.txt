User-Defined Error Rates for ddRAD Data Sets:
Per base error rates for short reads on Illumina sequencers may range from 0.1 - 1.0% (Peterson et al. 2012 
- "Double Digest RADseq: An Inexpensive Method for De Novo SNP Discovery and Genotyping in Model and 
Non-Model Species"), and this error rate does not reflect errors that may accumulate due to post-sequencing 
read processing (e.g., building stacks of reads into loci). Therefore, for all ddRAD data sets (i.e., Atrox, 
Beaded Lizard, Cobra, and Nepalese Viper), we have set the error rate to 0.01 (1%).

User-Defined Error Rates for Microsatellite Data Sets:
The error rate for all microsatellite data sets (i.e., Anaconda and condor) was set to 0.01, which is the 
value assumed in microsatellite simulations by Kalinowski et al. (2007 - "Revising how the computer program cervus accommodates genotyping 
error increases success in paternity assignment").

User-Defined Error Rate for WGS/SNP-Array Data:
The crocodile data set was generated via whole-genome sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq 6000 followed by 
stringent filtering (Booth et al. 2023 - "Discovery of facultative parthenogenesis in a new world 
crocodile"). Therefore, the error rate was set to 0.001.
