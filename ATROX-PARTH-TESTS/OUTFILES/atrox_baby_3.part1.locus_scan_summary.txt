Parameters:
	Infile = ATROX-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/atrox_baby_3.csv
	Outfile = ATROX-PARTH-TESTS/OUTFILES/atrox_baby_3
	Error = 0.01
	Het_Scan = 0


Total number of loci analyzed: 4228


Maternal Homozygous Locus Scan Summary:
	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 1445
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 819
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 14.45
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.56678
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.43322


Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.51679


THE OFFSPRING IS UNLIKELY TO BE A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is greater than the number expected from the genotyping error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes may be due to presence of paternal alleles.


Note: Part 2 maternal heterozygosity analysis will not be conducted to test for mode of parthenogenesis.
Note: Part 2 heterozygosity outfiles will not be created.
