Note on Zebra Shark Parthenogenesis Tests

ParthenoGenius requires that the mother is homozygous for at least 1 locus in order to test for parthenogenesis, a condition 
that is usually met particularly in large SNP data sets and often met in microsatellite data sets. However,in this data set  
mother F2(2009) was heterozygous at all loci. Therefore, ParthenoGenius was not run on the mother/offspring pair 
F2(2009)/2016:5.
