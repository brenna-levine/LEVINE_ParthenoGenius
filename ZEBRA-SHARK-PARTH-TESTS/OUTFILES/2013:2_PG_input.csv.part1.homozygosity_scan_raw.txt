The following are the IDs for the loci at which the mom is homozygous. Loci at which the mom or offspring have missing data are not included.
If an offspring allele differs from the maternal homozygous genotype, the incongruous maternal allele and offspring allele are printed below the locus.

Please refer to the maternal homozygous loci scan summary output file for summary statistics.


Locus: Sfa418

	Mom homozygous allele: 231
	Offspring allele 1: 225
	Offspring allele 2: 231
