Total number of loci analyzed: 16


Maternal Homozygous Locus Scan Summary:
	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 2
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 0.1
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.0
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 1.0


Maternal Heterozygous Locus Scan Summary:
	Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 14
	Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from those represented in the maternal alleles: 0
	Maximum number of offspring loci expected to exhibit alternate alleles from maternal genotype based on error rate: 0.7
	Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.0
	Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has identical heterozygous genotypes to maternal heterozygous genotypes: 1.0


Maternal Locus Scan Summary (all loci):
	Number of mom's loci (homozygous and heterogygous) for which offspring exhibits an allele differing from maternal genotype: 0
	Maximum number of loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 0.8
	Proportion of mom's loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.0


Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.125


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than expected from the error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes is likely due to genotyping error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
