Parameters:
	Infile = anaconda-2015-OS1.csv
	Outfile = ../OUTFILES/anaconda-2015-OS1
	Error = 0.01
	Het_Scan = 0


Total number of loci analyzed: 16


Maternal Homozygous Locus Scan Summary:
	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 2
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 0
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.0
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 1.0


Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.125


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than expected from the genotyping error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes is likely due to genotyping error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
