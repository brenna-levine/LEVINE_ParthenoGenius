Parameters:
	Infile = ERROR-RATE-TESTS/NEPALESE-VIPER-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/BLACKLIST_DIR/NVP-009_PG_input.csv
	Outfile = ERROR-RATE-TESTS/NEPALESE-VIPER-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/BLACKLIST_DIR/NVP-009_PG_input.csv_0.020
	Error = 0.020


Total number of loci in input file scanned (may include loci with missing data): 9697


THE FOLLOWING STATS REFERS ONLY TO LOCI AT WHICH NEITHER THE MOTHER NOR OFFSPRING HAVE MISSING DATA:

	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous and offspring are not missing data: 4087
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 1529
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 81.74
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.37411
	Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.62589


THE OFFSPRING IS UNLIKELY TO BE A PARTHENOGEN.

	The number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is greater than the number expected from the genotyping error rate alone.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes may be due to presence of paternal alleles.


Note: Part 2 maternal heterozygosity analysis will not be conducted to test for mode of parthenogenesis.
Note: Part 2 heterozygosity outfiles will not be created.
