The following are the IDs for the loci at which the mom is heterozygous. Loci at which the mother or offspring have missing data are not included.
If the offspring is heterozygous for the mom's alleles, the mom's and offspring's alleles are printed below.

Please refer to the maternal heterozygous loci summary output file for summary statistics.
