The following are the IDs for the loci at which the mom is homozygous. Loci at which the mom or offspring have missing data are not included.
If an offspring allele differs from the maternal homozygous genotype, the incongruous maternal allele and offspring allele are printed below the locus.

Please refer to the maternal homozygous loci scan summary output file for summary statistics.


Locus: EmuTri008

	Mom homozygous allele: 190
	Offspring allele 1: 172
	Offspring allele 2: 190

Locus: EmuTri013

	Mom homozygous allele: 166
	Offspring allele 1: 160
	Offspring allele 2: 166
