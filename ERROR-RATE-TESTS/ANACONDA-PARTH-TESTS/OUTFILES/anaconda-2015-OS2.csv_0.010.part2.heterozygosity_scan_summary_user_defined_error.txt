SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci in input file scanned: 16
Number of loci in input file with missing data: 0
Total number of loci for which mom and offspring do not have missing data: 16
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 14
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained maternal heterozygosity: 0
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication: 0.14
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (based on retained heterozyosity assumption of 66%): 9.24
Range of numbers of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of terminal fusion automixis: > 0.14 - < 9.24
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of endoduplication: >= 13.86
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.0

Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.125


This parthenogen was likely produced via:	GAMETIC DUPLICATION

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is less than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication.
	Therefore, any apparent offspring heterozygosity at these loci is likely an artifact of error.
