SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci in input file scanned: 39746
Number of loci in input file with missing data: 0
Total number of loci for which mom and offspring do not have missing data: 39746
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 1026
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained maternal heterozygosity: 34
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication: 25.65
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (based on retained heterozyosity assumption of 66%): 677.16
Range of numbers of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of terminal fusion automixis: > 25.65 - < 677.16
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of endoduplication: >= 1000.35
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.033

Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.97474


This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication and less than the number expected given an alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (assuming at last 66% retained maternal heterozygosity).
