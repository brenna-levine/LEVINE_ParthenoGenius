SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci in input file scanned: 100
Number of loci in input file with missing data: 4
Total number of loci for which mom and offspring do not have missing data: 96
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 63
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained maternal heterozygosity: 63
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0.0
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (based on retained heterozyosity assumption of 66%): 41.58
Range of numbers of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of terminal fusion automixis: > 0.0 - < 41.58
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of endoduplication: >= 63.0
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 1.0

Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 2.0


This parthenogen was likely produced via:	ENDODUPLICATION

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected considering genotyping error and an alternative hypothesis of endoduplication.

***Note: 100% retention of maternal heterozygosity is also a potential outcome of central fusion automixis, but it is highly unlikely as it would require zero recombination.
