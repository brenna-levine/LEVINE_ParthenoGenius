SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 200
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 60
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.0

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	GAMETIC DUPLICATION

	The proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is less than the estimated error rate from the maternal locus scan.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is likely an artifact of error.
