SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci in input file scanned: 100
Number of loci in input file with missing data: 4
Total number of loci for which mom and offspring do not have missing data: 96
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 63
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained maternal heterozygosity: 47
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0.0
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (based on retained heterozyosity assumption of 66%): 41.58
Range of numbers of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of terminal fusion automixis: > 0.0 - < 41.58
Minimum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming alternative hypothesis of endoduplication: >= 63.0
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.746

Genotype Sharing Index (Mxy):
	Per Blouin et al. 1996, Mxy ranges from 0 - 2, as individuals can share up to 2 alleles per locus

		Mxy: 1.83333


This parthenogen was likely produced via:	CENTRAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected given an alternative hypothesis of central fusion automixis (assuming at least 66% retained maternal heterozygosity).
