Parameters:
	Infile = NEPALESE-VIPER-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/BLACKLIST_DIR/NVP-009_PG_input.csv.part1.homozygosity_scan_summary.txt
	Outfile = NEPALESE-VIPER-PARTH-TESTS/INFILES/BLACKLIST_DIR/NVP-009_PG_input.csv.part1.homozygosity_scan_summary.txt
	Error = 0.01


Total number of loci in input file scanned (may include loci with missing data): 0


THE FOLLOWING STATS REFERS ONLY TO LOCI AT WHICH NEITHER THE MOTHER NOR OFFSPRING HAVE MISSING DATA:

	Number of loci for which mom is homozygous and offspring are not missing data: 0
	Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0
	Maximum number of homozygous loci expected to differ between mom and offspring based on error rate: 0.0
