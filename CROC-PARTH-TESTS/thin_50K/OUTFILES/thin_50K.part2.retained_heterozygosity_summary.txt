SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 39746
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 1026
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 34
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0.31798
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.03314

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL OR CENTRAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is not likely an artifact of error.
