SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 191255
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 5015
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 152
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 2.23499
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.03031

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL OR CENTRAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is not likely an artifact of error.
