SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 78603
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 2023
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 76
Maximum number of mom's heterozygous loci expected to be heterozygous in offspring assuming null hypothesis of gametic duplication (based on error rate): 0.87176
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.03757

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL OR CENTRAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the number expected based on estimated error rate alone assuming a null hypothesis of gametic duplication.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is not likely an artifact of error.
