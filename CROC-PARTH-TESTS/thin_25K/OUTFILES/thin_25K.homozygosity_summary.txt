SUMMARY OF RESULTS: SCAN OF MATERNAL HOMOZYGOUS LOCI FOR DISCORDANT OFFSPRING GENOTYPES

Total number of loci analyzed: 78603
Number of loci for which mom is homozygous: 76580
Number of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 33
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles: 0.00043
Proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which offspring has identical homozygous genotypes to maternal homozygous genotypes: 0.99957


THE OFFSPRING IS LIKELY A PARTHENOGEN.

	The proportion of mom's homozygous loci for which at least one of offspring's alleles differs from maternal alleles is less than the error rate.
	Incongruence between maternal genotypes and offspring genotypes at these loci is likely due to sequencing error rather than the presence of paternal alleles.
