SUMMARY: SCAN OF MATERNAL HETEROZYGOUS LOCI FOR OFFSPRING RETAINED HETEROZYGOSITY

Total number of loci analyzed: 78603
Number of loci for which mom is heterozygous: 2023
Number of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 76
Proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity: 0.03757

This parthenogen was likely produced via:	TERMINAL FUSION AUTOMIXIS

	The proportion of mom's heterozygous loci for which offspring has retained heterozygosity is greater than the estimated error rate from the homozygosity scan.
	Therefore, offspring heterozygosity at these loci is not likely an artifact of sequencing error.
